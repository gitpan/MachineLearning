Revision history for the module distribution MachineLearning::*

1.01    2009-05-25    original version

1.02    2009-07-02    Improved the implementation of the
                      "special_number" data type in DecisionTrees.pm
                      so that zero (0) values are no longer included
                      in the calculation of the mean and standard
                      deviation for non-negative numbers.  Instead,
                      there are now negative values, zero values, and
                      positive values rather than negative and
                      non-negative values.

1.03    2009-08-30    Added the IntegerAnnealing module.
